# AirbnbPricePrediction

## Description
This project focuses on developing a predictive model for forecasting the pricing of Airbnb listings before they are made available on the market. By leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques, the goal is to create a robust algorithm that can analyze various factors influencing the pricing dynamics of Airbnb accommodations. These factors may include location, amenities, number of beds, ... 

There are two usage scenarios for the program:
- When a user wants to list their property on Airbnb, they can use this tool to determine the most appropriate price.
- It allows a user looking to stay in a specific accommodation to check if the property is more expensive than it should be or, on the contrary, a great deal."

## Context of the project

This project was undertaken as part of the Introduction to Data Science course at the University of Sk√∂vde in Sweden, during my exchange semester from the University of Technology of Troyes. It is important to note that the project was an individual project, not a group project.

## Dataset

The data is sourced from [Airbnb - Listings](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/airbnb-listings/).
The productor of the dataset is "Inside Airbnb" under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) "Public Domain Dedication" license.

This dataset provides several informations about Airbnb accommodations (price, number of rooms, type of listing, etc.) for several cities in the world. 

The dataset should be downloaded using the provided link then by clicking on the 'Export' tab and selecting 'CSV.' Afterwards, it should be placed in a folder named 'data.' The project structure must follow:
